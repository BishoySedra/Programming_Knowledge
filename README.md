# ReactJS Notes

Here are some key concepts to understand when working with ReactJS:

- **JSX**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It is not a necessity to write React applications, but it's a recommended way to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript. It allows you to write HTML code inside your JavaScript, making it easier to create React elements.

- **Components in ReactJS**: In ReactJS, a component is essentially a JavaScript function or class that optionally accepts inputs i.e., properties (props) and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI should appear. The simplicity of components allows for more modularity and reusability in your applications.

Remember, React is all about building reusable components. In fact, with React, you're usually building small components that turn into larger ones. This makes your code more predictable and easier to debug, a huge advantage when building large scale applications.
